For Android Galaxy SII (currently unstatble). I made this app after I finished CSE 142 which translates to programming 101. I don't have plan to learn further my Android developement skill for now but I will do it in the near future. I will most likely to ignore this bug because the OS was running on Ice Cream Sandwich at the time.
